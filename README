wildcatting-ai is an oil drilling agent


Agent initialization:

wcai init <agent> [--force] [--components {surveying report drilling sales}]

Creates the following filesystem structure:

agent/
    surveying/
	training/
	surveying.net
    report/
	training/
	report.net
    drilling/
	training/
	drilling.net
    sales/
	training/
	sales.net

Data for supervised learning may be copied into the training directories for
each component for use by the bootstrap command. The .net files contain weights
for the neural networks that back each component.


Bootstrapping:

wcai bootstrap <agent> <component>

Individual components are trained using supervised learning on explicit
training data. This may help point things in the right general direction when
unsupervised reinforcement learning begins. However, this is an optional step
and can be used on as many or few of the components as desired.


Reinforcement learning:

wcai learn [--games <num>] [--components {surveying report drilling sales}]

Here the agent plays itself repeatedly. Some subset of the components may be
specified for update, while non updating components will remain frozen.
Specifying less than the full set of components may be advantageous when some
components have been reasonably bootstrapped while others have not.
